        <h2>Starting on own</h2>
        <em>22 Jan 2021</em>
        <p>I started my chess career as a chess player and teacher very long ago, but starting my own club I had never thought of. In this covid time I have been teachin for US kids chess and the kids have been growing. So I thought of creating my own website and chess club this time including my friends as a team. My other friends also play chess like me. We had few meeting and finalized the name (to keep it as Mindlabz chess club) then I designed the website and hosted it on netlify, I have not written much code for this website I have took the code template from tailwind css website and just copy pasted it from there as we needed the website quickly, But I have been practicing designing and Javascript part, now coming to domain I was not knowing how to purchase the it and use it, I tried googling things and finally purchased the domain. 
            Many new things I have learnt from doing this I will make a list below of these 
        <ol><li>Team Work is not as simple as it looks</li>
        <li>Purchasing Domain</li>
    <li>Creating branch and then testing the website before deplyoing to main website</li>
<li>Taking the inputs from front end to back end, which I did with the help of simple google sheet</li></ol>

Its fun to work in team and keep learning newe things, lets hope for the best in future. Thank you for reading my blog.</p>
